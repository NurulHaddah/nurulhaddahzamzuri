<p style="background-color: oldlace; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; ">Coronavirus sickness is a sort of pandemic that has spread over the world. The world has been put on lockdown as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, with all services except the country's emergency services being shut down. The school and college were also closed. Our government's commitment to combatting the COVID-19 epidemic, we've been ordered to stay indoors since March 2020 and to transition to open distance learning (ODL), which is performed via e-learning, in order to maintain our social distance. The MCO has an impact on me as a student because of its Online Distance Learning programme (ODL). Because I had no past experience with ODL, I was sceptical at first. Furthermore, my internet connection in my neighbourhood is slow. I'm worried about how it will affect my ODL operation. However, everything went smoothly, and I gradually became accustomed to this ODL. However, I feel that ODL can offer a variety of benefits to both students and educators. 
Thanks to online learning, I was able to get the capacity to change my profession and be disciplined. I've also learned to be self-disciplined, and I believe that my productivity has improved as a result of my online learning. Thanks to online programmes, I've learned how to be a successful distance learner. Not only can online classes aid me, but they also help me protect my future, my life, and my studies. Finally, I'd like to thank all of the faculty members for their support during this difficult time.</p>
